    <h1>Final Project Proposal</h1>
        <h3>By Yu(Monica) Liang</h3>

        <h2>Project Description</h2>

            <p>For my final project (individual project), I would like to create a static webpage introducing traditional cuisine in my hometown (Shandong Cuisine) and localize it into Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese.</p>

        <h2>Tools and Resources</h2>
            <p>I will be using HTML, CSS and Javascript to create the original webpage with appropriate styling and interactive elements. Articles, links and photos on the webpage are contents from Wikipedia or other online resources.

            For the localization process, I will use Trados to translate the HTML file. If necessary, relevant termbases will be created to produce consistent translation.</p>

        <h2>Webpage Discription</h2>
            <p>This webpage consists of three parts: 
                <ul>
        	        <li>Articles</li>
        	            <p>Articles introducting Shandong Cuisine.</p>
        	        <li>Photos</li>
        	            <p>Photos taken by me or from online resources.</p>
        	        <li>Interactive quizzes or games</li>
        	            <p>Interactive elements created with Javascript to test what the readers have learned from reading the articles.</p>

                </ul>
            </p>

        <h2>Steps for Localization</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Use Trados to set up filters for the translation of the HTML file</li>
              <li>Run a pseudo translation based on the filter</li>
              <li>Translate the content of the webpage in Trados</li>
              <li>Run QA process to ensure everything is successfully localizaed into the desired languages</li>
            </ul>
