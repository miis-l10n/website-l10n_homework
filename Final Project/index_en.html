            	<h2>Smartling</h2>
                <p>Smartling actually provides you with three different translation options. The cheapest and fastest is machine translation, but it’s also the least accurate. Giving you the best middle ground is crowdsourced translation; it is relatively inexpensive and can be almost as accurate as the professional translation service. Pricing varies by content and traffic volume. As an added bonus, Smartling can host your new language sites for you, leaving you responsible only to host your root language version. </p>

                <h2>Transifex</h2>
               <p>If you want to manage your own website translation project, then something like Transifex might be a good fit. It has been designed for “agile teams and smart translators,” adhering to the principles of agile project management. Pricing starts at $19/month, not including the cost of your crowdsourced translators.</p>

                <h2>Gengo</h2>
               <p>Working either through online submission or by way of the API, Gengo employs a team of pre-tested translators. When the translation is complete, you can review and comment on the translation, getting corrections for free. The finished project is then delivered to you via email or back through the API. Standard pricing starts at $0.05 per word and goes up to about $0.15/word for the “ultra” level, which includes professional-grade service with extra proofreading.</p>

                <h2>Lingotek</h2>
          
               <p>Instead of relying on a single translator to handle your website translation, Lingotek uses what it calls a “translation network.” This includes its collaborative translation platform, but also its translation marketplace, partner network and development community. While website localization is certainly part of it, LingoTek has a network of translation freelancers who can also do desktop publishing, subtitling, transcription and voice-over work, among other services.</p>
