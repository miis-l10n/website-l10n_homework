### **Project Description**

The project aims to build a webpage with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and any other web development language/tool used in the Website Localization course and to localize it into Chinese. The basic structure of the webpage will be HTML, which will be styled using CSS. With JavaScript, the webpage will be able to include interactive elements.

There are two choices for the topic of the webpage.

1. **Personal professional portfolio**:

 a personal profile and a portfolio of projects;

2. **Travelogue**:

 an album showcasing the pictures taken by the designer during her recent trips in the U.S. with brief travel journals.

The webpage will be localized into Chinese. There are two methods to do it. Choice of the localization method will be based on the complexity of the webpage.

1. Translate in the source code;
2. Create appropriate filters and translate the files (.html, .js, etc.) in a CAT tool.
