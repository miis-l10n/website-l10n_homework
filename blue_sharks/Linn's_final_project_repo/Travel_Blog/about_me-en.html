		<h3>Localizer | Linguist | Traveller | Rookie Web Designer | Radio Host | Guitarist | Equestrian</h3>
		<p>My Chinese name is Hu Chenchen. Lin was my original family name. I made it my English name to remember the history of my family and to honor my grandparents who have been through many hard times in their life. I am from Lishui, a beautiful small town in East China.</p>

		<p>Currently I am a Translation and Localization Management student at Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey (formerly MIIS). Before coming to Monterey, I was a graduate student studying interpreting in Guangzhou, South China.</p>

		<p>I enjoy good food, music, travel and quirky fun things. My favorite sport is equestrianism (aka horseback riding). I rode once for a unique wedding when Rabbit (my horse) and I trotted around the City! No thing feels cooler than a great ride!</p>
